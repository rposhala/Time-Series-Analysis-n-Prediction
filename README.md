# Time-Series-Analysis-n-Prediction

For this project, Apple Inc. stock data of last 20 years (July 18th, 2000 to July 18th, 2020) has been picked. And this project focusses on forecasting this time series data with the help of both classical time series forecasting methods and Deep learning time series forecasting methods

Statiscal models like ARIMA, SARIMA, SES and Deep learning models like MLP and LSTM architecture were implementation.

Results from the above implementated models were compared. Meaningful insights and observations were presented.
